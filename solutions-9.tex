    \begin{enumerate}
        \item On the right side, we are given transition maps. 
        
        We have that
        \begin{align*}
            \alpha_{| U_0\cap U_1}^{-1} \circ \beta_{| U_0\cap U_1}
        \end{align*}
        is invertible, because by assumption $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are isomorphisms. 
        To see injectivity, remember that given sheaves on a cover and transition maps,
        we can uniquely (up to isomorphism) glue them to get a sheaf on the whole space.

        Well definedness of this map comes from the fact that if two vector bundles 
        $V_1\cong V_2$ are ismorphic, then the transition map is the same.

        It remains to show surjectivity.
        
        \item dots
        \item 
        Claim: Every line bundle on $\Proj^1$ can be written as 
        \begin{align*}
            \mathcal{O}_{\Proj^1}(d_n)\oplus \dots \oplus \mathcal{O}_{\Proj ^1}(d_n).
        \end{align*}
        
        Proof of claim:

        By part 1 of this exercise, we can characterize the isomorphism classes of rank n vector bundles by looking at the transition functions. 

        In the second part of this exercise, we showed that (for $n=2$, but actually inductively for all $n$) these 
        transition functions can be writte as $T^d$. The claim now follows from observing that the transition matrix of 
        \begin{align*}
            \mathcal{O}_{\Proj^1}(d_n)\oplus \dots \oplus \mathcal{O}_{\Proj ^1}(d_n)
        \end{align*}
        is given by
        \begin{align*}
            T^{(d_1,\dots, d_n)}.
        \end{align*}
    \end{enumerate}
