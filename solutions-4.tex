    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Let $X$ be a finite set that is irreducible with 
        respect to some topology $\mathbb{F}$ on $X$. Then we get
        $\mid \mathbb{F} \mid<\infty$ and since finite unions of
        closed sets are closed again we get that
        \begin{align*}
            X^{\prime}:=\bigcup_{U \subsetneq X \text{closed}}
        \end{align*}
        is closed in X. Since $X$ is by assumption irreducible,
        $X\neq X^{\prime}$, so we can pick $x_0\in X \backslash X^{\prime}$,
        which is by construction generic. The second part is then an immediate
        consequence of part 2 of Hochster's Theorem. As a finite set, $X$ is 
        quasicompact and as a basis $\mathcal{B}$ just take all of the open sets. 
        It remains to show that $X$ is sober.
