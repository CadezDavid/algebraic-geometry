    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Let $X$ be a finite set that is irreducible with 
        respect to some topology $\mathcal{F}$ on $X$. Then we get
        $\mid \mathcal{F} \mid<\infty$ and since finite unions of
        closed sets are closed again, we get that
        \begin{align*}
            X^{\prime}:=\bigcup_{U \subsetneq X \text{closed}}{U}
        \end{align*}
        is closed in X. Since $X$ is by assumption irreducible,
        $X\neq X^{\prime}$, so we can pick $x_0\in X \backslash X^{\prime}$,
        which is by construction generic. The second part is then a
        consequence of part 2 of Hochster's Theorem. As a finite set, $X$ is 
        quasicompact and as a basis $\mathcal{B}$ consisting of quasicompact 
        open sets stable under finite intersections take all of the open sets. 
        It remains to show that $X$ is sober. This comes from the fact that 
        in $T_0$ spaces, generic points are unique, which is an immediate consequence
        of the definition of generic point.
