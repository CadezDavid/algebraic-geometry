    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Let $X$ be a finite set that is irreducible with 
        respect to some topology $\mathcal{F}$ on $X$. Then we get
        $\mid \mathcal{F} \mid<\infty$ and since finite unions of
        closed sets are closed again, we get that
        \begin{align*}
            X^{\prime}:=\bigcup_{U \subsetneq X \text{closed}}{U}
        \end{align*}
        is closed in X. Since $X$ is by assumption irreducible,
        $X\neq X^{\prime}$, so we can pick $x_0\in X \backslash X^{\prime}$,
        which is by construction generic. For the second part of the exercise we use 
        part 2 of Hochster's Theorem. As a finite set, $X$ is 
        quasicompact and as a basis $\mathcal{B}$ consisting of quasicompact 
        open sets stable under finite intersections take all of the open sets. \\
        It remains to show that $X$ is sober. We need to check that every irreducible
        subset of $X$ has a unique generic point. The existence of a generic point comes
        from part of of this exercise. Uniqueness of this point is due to the fact
        that generic points in $T_0$ spaces are unique if they exist, which follows directly
        from the definition of $T_0$.
