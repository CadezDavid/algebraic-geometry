    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Since $k$ is algebraically closed, the only irreducible polynomials $f\in k[x,y]$ are of degree $1$.
        
        Hence, we can write 
        \begin{align*}
            f_r=l_1 \odot \dots \odot l_r,
        \end{align*}
        where $l_i\in k[x,y]$ is of degree $1$. From the assumption that $f_r$ is homogenous it follows that the $l_i$ are homogenous.

        Therefore, we can write
        \begin{align*}
            Z=V(f_r)=V(l_1 \odot \dots \odot l_r)=\cup_i V(l_i)
        \end{align*}
        and since $V(l_i)$ is a line through the origin, $Z$ can be written as the finite union of lines through the origin.
    \end{enumerate}
