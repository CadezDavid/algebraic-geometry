\begin{exercise}{1}
    As suggested in the hint, we know that $y$ and $3x^2 + a$ do not both vanish
    at no point on the curve (they are coefficients of the Jacobi matrix, which
    is invertible on $E$).

    The differential form $\mathrm{d}x / 2y$ is defined on $D(y)$ and
    $\mathrm{d}y / (3 x^2 + a)$ is defined on $D(3 x^2 + a)$.

    We have to check they match on $D(y (3 x^2 + a))$. On $E \cap D_+(z)$ we
    have $y^2 - x^3 - a x - b = 0$, so also $2 y\ \mathrm{d} y - (3 x^2 + a)\ \mathrm{d} x
    = 0$ and therefore $\mathrm{d}x / 2y = \mathrm{d}y / (3 x^2 + a)$ whenever
    both $y$ and $3x^2 + a$ are invertible.

    Now we show that this form can be extended to a global section in
    $\Omega^1_{E / k}(E)$.
    Observe that only point $k$-rational point on the curve that is not
    contained in $D(z)$ is $[0:1:0]$. That means we can cover the curve, as
    usually, with $D(z) \cup D(y)$. But clearly the section $\mathrm{d}x / 2y$
    can be extended (or, is defined) on the whole $D(y)$, so indeed on whole
    $D(y) \cap E$.
    % If we identify $D(y) = \Aff^2_k = \Spec(k[x, y, z] / (y - 1))$, the
    % differential form $\mathrm{d}x / 2y$ is $\mathrm{d}x / 2$.
