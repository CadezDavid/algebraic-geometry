    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Since $k$ is algebraically closed, the only irreducible polynomials $f\in k[x,y]$ are of degree $1$.
        
        Hence, we can write 
        \begin{align*}
            f_r=l_1  \dots  l_r,
        \end{align*}
        where $l_i\in k[x,y]$ is of degree $1$. From the assumption that $f_r$ is homogenous it follows that the $l_i$ are homogenous.

        Therefore, we can write
        \begin{align*}
            Z=V(f_r)=V(l_1 \dots  l_r)=\cup_i V(l_i)
        \end{align*}
        and since $V(l_i)$ is a line through the origin, $Z$ can be written as the finite union of lines through the origin.

        \item Assume that $r=1$, i.e. $X=V(f_1).$
        We want to show that for $x=\lbrace 0 \rbrace$ we have that$\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ is a field, which would imply that it is regular.

        We calculate 
        \begin{align*}
            \mathcal{O}_{X,x}=\varinjlim_{x\in D(g)} k[x,y]/f_1 [g^{-1}]=\varinjlim_{x\in D(g)} k[u] [g^{-1}]=K(A),
        \end{align*}
        using that $f_1$ is homogenous of degree $1$ and where $K(A)$ is the field of fractions of $A$.

        \item By part two of this exercise, all the schemes have a singular point at the origin. I don't know why they do not have singular
        points anywhere else.
    \end{enumerate}
